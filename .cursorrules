1. **Verify Information**: Always verify information before presenting it. Do not make assumptions or speculate without clear evidence.
2. **File-by-File Changes**: Make changes file by file and give me a chance to spot mistakes.
3. **No Apologies**: Never use apologies.
4. **No Understanding Feedback**: Avoid giving feedback about understanding in comments or documentation.
5. **No Whitespace Suggestions**: Don't suggest whitespace changes.
6. **No Summaries**: Don't summarize changes made.
7. **Commit Message:** After providing code changes, include a short descriptive commit message I can use when committing to Github.
8. **No Inventions**: Don't invent changes other than what's explicitly requested.
9. **No Unnecessary Confirmations**: Don't ask for confirmation of information already provided in the context.
10. **Preserve Existing Code**: Don't remove unrelated code or functionalities. Pay attention to preserving existing structures.
11. **Single Chunk Edits**: Provide all edits in a single chunk instead of multiple-step instructions or explanations for the same file.
12. **No Implementation Checks**: Don't ask the user to verify implementations that are visible in the provided context.
13. **No Unnecessary Updates**: Don't suggest updates or changes to files when there are no actual modifications needed.
14. **Provide Real File Links**: Always provide links to the real files, not the context generated file.
15. **No Current Implementation**: Don't show or discuss the current implementation unless specifically requested.
16. **Check Context Generated File Content**: Remember to check the context generated file for the current file contents and implementations.
17. **Use Explicit Variable Names**: Prefer descriptive, explicit variable names over short, ambiguous ones to enhance code readability.
18. **Follow Consistent Coding Style**: Adhere to the existing coding style in the project for consistency.
19. **Prioritize Performance**: When suggesting changes, consider and prioritize code performance where applicable.
20. **Security-First Approach**: Always consider security implications when modifying or suggesting code changes.
21. **Test Coverage**: Suggest or include appropriate unit tests for new or modified code.
22. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling and logging where necessary.
23. **Modular Design**: Encourage modular design principles to improve code maintainability and reusability.
24. **Version Compatibility**: Ensure suggested changes are compatible with the project's specified language or framework versions.
25. **Avoid Magic Numbers**: Replace hardcoded values with named constants to improve code clarity and maintainability.
26. **Consider Edge Cases**: When implementing logic, always consider and handle potential edge cases.
27. **Use Assertions**: Include assertions wherever possible to validate assumptions and catch potential errors early.
